## Projects

### Full Stack Data Analytics/Science Projects

| No. | Project | Tools | Steps & Keywords | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| 1 | üí≥ [Predictive Churn Analysis in Credit Card Banking](https://github.com/namanh-ph/Predictive-Churn-Analysis-in-Credit-Card-Banking) | Excel, SQL, Power BI, Python | Data cleaning, statistical tests, data visualisation, data analysis, ML model building (supervised clustering - Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost), PyCaret | The consumer credit card bank is facing an issue of a decent number of customer churn. It is necessary to analyse to discover the reason, and find out which customer is more likely to cancel their service in the future. This project utilises various tools to perform various tasks: from data cleaning to statistical tests and machine learning models. |
| 2 | üë• [E-Commerce Online Retail Analysis](https://github.com/namanh-ph/E-Commerce-Online-Retail-Analysis) | Python | Data cleaning, data visualisation, data analysis, ML model building (unsupervised clustering: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering), RFM, Pandas-Profiling | This project investigates an online retail store in the UK to discover important information about the sales so that the store can improve upon, and classify the customers into different types in order to approach them appropriately with different strategies. Customers are categorised by their respective RFM (Recency - Frequency - Monetary) values. |

### Stock Market Time-Series Analysis

| No. | Project | Tools | Steps & Keywords | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| 3 | üíπ [ARIMA-GARCH Stock Price Volatility Prediction](https://github.com/namanh-ph/ARIMA-GARCH-Stock-Price-Volatility-Prediction) | Python | Time-series analysis, ARIMA, GJR-GARCH | Predicting the stock market's movements remains an arduous challenge, and one approach to accomplish this lies in the development of stock market prediction models, leveraging historical data and advanced analytical techniques to anticipate future market trends. This study aims to perform a price volatility prediction, using the combination of ARIMA and GARCH model. |
| 4 | üíª [Stock Price Prediction - LSTM vs Transformer](https://github.com/namanh-ph/Stock-Price-Prediction-LSTM-vs-Transformer) | Python | Time-series analysis, RNN, Transformer | The topic of predicting stock market price has numerous approaches, with a variety of models to choose and implement. In this case, my aim is to evaluate and compare the performance of two neural network architecture - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Transformer - in predicting the closing price of a stock. |

### Financial Analysis

| No. | Project | Tools | Steps & Keywords | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| 5 | üíµ [Portfolio Optimisation with Monte Carlo Simulation](https://github.com/namanh-ph/Portfolio-Optimisation-with-Monte-Carlo-Simulation) | Excel, Python | Portfolio optimisation, Monte Carlo simulation, risk-return analysis, portfolio construction, sharpe ratio, stock market analysis, financial modelling | This project explores the optimisation of stock portfolios from Vietnam's VN30 index through Monte Carlo simulation. Through risk-return analysis, constructing and evaluating portfolios with diverse stock allocations, my aim is to identify the optimal balance between annual return and volatility for superior portfolio performance. |

### Blockchain and Software Development

| No. | Project | Tools | Steps & Keywords | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| 6 | ‚öôÔ∏è [Blockchain Appplication Using Ethereum Smart Contracts And Solidity](https://github.com/namanh-ph/Blockchain-App-using-Etherium-Smart-Contract-Solidity) | Ethereum, Truffle, Ganache, Solidity, Web3.js | Smart Contracts, Blockchain, Decentralized Applications (dApps), Deployment, Testing | This project aims to create and deploy a blockchain application (a simple to-do list) using Ethereum and Solidity. This includes the development of smart contracts and their testing and deployment on the Ethereum network, utilising Truffle and Ganache for a robust development environment. |

### Business Case Studies

| No. | Project | Tools | Steps & Keywords | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| 7 | üìö [8-week SQL Challenge](https://github.com/namanh-ph/8-week-SQL-Challenge) | SQL | Data cleaning, data extraction, data analysis | The 8-week SQL challenge is a series of case studies that can be solved using SQL. It consists of projects that participants can undertake to practise and apply their SQL knowledge. The challenges are designed to simulate common data analysis tasks that one might encounter in a professional setting. |
| 8 | üéí [Business Case: Hotel Bookings](https://github.com/namanh-ph/Business-Case-Hotel-Bookings) | SQL, Power BI | Data cleaning, data visualisation, data analysis | For one hotel company, a closer look at their customer base reveals that the majority of their guests are domestic visitors. The focus of this study is on understanding the behaviour of overseas visitors, so that the company may deploy strategies to attract them, through the means of SQL (data cleaning) and Power BI visualisation. |
| 9 | ‚ö° [Business Case: American Energy Market Regulator](https://github.com/namanh-ph/Business-Case-American-Energy-Market-Regulator) | SQL, Tableau | Data extraction, data visualisation, data analysis | The American Energy Market Regulator is responsible for looking after the USA‚Äôs domestic energy network. Recently, a large number of outages has been noticed, and it is the task to discover deeper insights into the current market. This case study utilises SQL to extract relevant figures to the problem, and Tableau for visualising the data. |
| 10 | üéØ [Business Case: ChemCorp Incorporated](https://github.com/namanh-ph/Business-Case-ChemCorp-Incorporated) | Tableau | Data visualisation, data analysis | ChemCorp is a leading producer of chemicals that has recently witnessed a decline in revenues and customers. How can ChemCorp prevent the loss of the future market? This case study collects insights and essential key figures through an extensive report with the aid of Tableau visualisation. |
