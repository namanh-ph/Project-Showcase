It is necessary to analyse to discover the reason, and find out which customer is more likely to cancel their service in the future. This project utilises various tools to perform various tasks: from data cleaning to statistical tests and machine learning models. |
| 3 | ðŸ‘¥ [E-Commerce Online Retail Analysis](https://github.com/nam-anh-21/E-Commerce-Online-Retail-Analysis) | Python | Data cleaning, data visualisation, data analysis, ML model building (unsupervised clustering - K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering), RFM, Pandas-Profiling | This project investigates an online retail store in the UK to discover important information about the sales so that the store can improve upon, and classify the customers into different types in order to approach them appropriately with different strategies. Customers are categorised by their respective RFM (Recency - Frequency - Monetary) values. |
| 4 | ðŸ“š [8-week SQL Challenge](https://github.com/nam-anh-21/8-week-SQL-Challenge) | SQL | Data cleaning, data extraction, data analysis | The 8-week SQL challenge is a series of case studies that can be solved using SQL. It consists of projects that participants can undertake to practise and apply their SQL knowledge. The challenges are designed to simulate common data analysis tasks that one might encounter in a professional setting. |
| 5 | ðŸŽ’ [Hotel Bookings](https://github.com/nam-anh-21/Hotel-Bookings) | SQL, Power BI | Data cleaning, data visualisation, data analysis | For one hotel company, a closer look at their customer base reveals that the majority of their guests are domestic visitors. The focus of this study is on understanding the behaviour of overseas visitors, so that the company may deploy strategies to attract them, through the means of SQL (data cleaning) and Power BI visualisation. |
| 6 | âš¡ [American Energy Market Regulator](https://github.com/nam-anh-21/American-Energy-Market-Regulator) | SQL, Tableau | Data extraction, data visualisation, data analysis | The American Energy Market Regulator is responsible for looking after the USAâ€™s domestic energy network. Recently, a large number of outages has been noticed, and it is the task to discover deeper insights into the current market. This case study utilises SQL to extract relevant figures to the problem, and Tableau for visualising the data. |
| 7 | ðŸ’µ [ChemCorp Incorporated](https://github.com/nam-anh-21/ChemCorp-Incorporated) | Tableau | Data visualisation, data analysis | ChemCorp is a leading producer of chemicals that has recently witnessed a decline in revenues and customers. How can ChemCorp prevent the loss of the future market? This case study collects insights and essential key figures through an extensive report with the aid of Tableau visualisation. |
